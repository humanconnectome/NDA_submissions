    a) If an item is omitted, that item receives no numerical score;


    b) Items indicated with an R are reverse items and must be scored in the following
    way:


    5 becomes 1

    4 becomes 2

    3 remains 3

    2 becomes 4

    1 becomes 5


    2. Divide the total by the number of items receiving a numerical response.  Do
    not include items receiving no response in determining the number of items.  For
    example, given a sum of 16 for a subscale of 6 items with one item receiving no
    response and 5 items receiving a numerical response, the sum of 16 would be divided
    by 5 to yield a mean of 3.2 for the subscale score.'
