    Your "partner" refers to any significant figure in your life that helps you in
    raising your children or has helped you for more than 2 years. This person should
    be involved in 40% or more of the daily activities your child does. For example,
    your partner could be your spouse. However your partner could also be a boyfriend/girlfriend
    or relative. If you have no partner, leave those questions blank. </p>'
